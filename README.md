# iTunes Local Control

A simple wrapper plugin to control local iTunes (i.e. on the same machine as Indigo) with applescript (via the approved applescript python module). I use it in conjunction with the official iTunes plugin to do things it can't like:

* Activate and deactivate airplay devices
* Set airplay device volumes (as % of master volume)
* Slow fade the master volume
* Set the shuffle mode (Songs, Albums, Groupings)
* Set the EQ on/off setting and preset
* Save/recall shuffle, repeat, volume, airplay, etc. to/from variables.

The complete list of available actions is quite extensive.
